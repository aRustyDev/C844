NOTE: as of 20070424, Oracle has not disputed reliable claims that DB03 occurs because RDBMS uses a NULL Discretionary Access Control List (DACL) for the Oracle process and certain shared memory sections, which allows local users to inject threads and execute arbitrary code via the OpenProcess, OpenThread, and SetThreadContext functions (DB03).
| [CVE-2007-2108] Unspecified vulnerability in the Core RDBMS component in Oracle Database 9.0.1.5, 9.2.0.8, 10.1.0.5, and 10.2.0.2 on Windows allows remote attackers to have an unknown impact, aka DB01.  NOTE: as of 20070424, Oracle has not disputed reliable claims that this issue occurs because the NTLM SSPI AcceptSecurityContext function grants privileges based on the username provided even though all users are authenticated as Guest, which allows remote attackers to gain privileges.
| [CVE-2007-2080] Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in XAMPP 1.6.0a for Windows allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via unspecified vectors in certain test scripts.
| [CVE-2007-2079] The ADONewConnection Connect function in adodb.php in XAMPP 1.6.0a and earlier for Windows uses untrusted input for the database server hostname, which allows remote attackers to trigger a library buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code via a long host parameter, or have other unspecified impact.  NOTE: it could be argued that this is an issue in mssql_connect (CVE-2007-1411.1) in PHP, or an issue in the ADOdb Library, and the proper fix should be in one of these products
| [CVE-2007-1981] The safevoid_vsnprintf function in Metamod-P 1.19p29 and earlier on Windows allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a long meta list command.

| [CVE-2007-1692] The default configuration of Microsoft Windows uses the Web Proxy Autodiscovery Protocol (WPAD) without static WPAD entries, which might allow remote attackers to intercept web traffic by registering a proxy server using WINS or DNS, then responding to WPAD requests, as demonstrated using Internet Explorer.  NOTE: it could be argued that if an attacker already has control over WINS/DNS, then web traffic could already be intercepted by modifying WINS or DNS records, so this would not cross privilege boundaries and would not be a vulnerability.  It has also been reported that DHCP is an alternate attack vector.
| [CVE-2007-1658] Windows Mail in Microsoft Windows Vista might allow user-assisted remote attackers to execute certain programs via a link to a (1) local file or (2) UNC share pathname in which there is a directory with the same base name as an executable program at the same level, as demonstrated using C:/windows/system32/winrm (winrm.cmd) and migwiz (migwiz.exe).
| [CVE-2007-1645] Buffer overflow in FutureSoft TFTP Server 2000 on Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long request on UDP port 69.  NOTE: this issue might overlap CVE-2006-4781 or CVE-2005-1812.
| [CVE-2007-1644] The dynamic DNS update mechanism in the DNS Server service on Microsoft Windows does not properly authenticate clients in certain deployments or configurations, which allows remote attackers to change DNS records for a web proxy server and conduct man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on web traffic, conduct pharming attacks by poisoning DNS records, and cause a denial of service (erroneous name resolution).
| [CVE-2007-1593] The administrative service in Symantec Veritas Volume Replicator (VVR) for Windows 3.1 through 4.3, and VVR for Unix 3.5 through 5.0, in Symantec Storage Foundation products allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and service crash) via a crafted packet to the service port (8199/tcp) that triggers a request for more memory than available, which causes the service to write to an invalid pointer.
