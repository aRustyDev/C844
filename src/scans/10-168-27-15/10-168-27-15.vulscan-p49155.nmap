| [CVE-2007-1528] The LLTD Mapper in Microsoft Windows Vista allows remote attackers to spoof hosts, and nonexistent bridge relationships, into the network topology map by using a MAC address that differs from the MAC address provided in the Real Source field of the LLTD BASE header of a HELLO packet, aka the "Spoof on Bridge" attack.
| [CVE-2007-1527] The LLTD Mapper in Microsoft Windows Vista does not verify that an IP address in a TLV type 0x07 field in a HELLO packet corresponds to a valid IP address for the local network, which allows remote attackers to trick users into communicating with an external host by sending a HELLO packet with the MW characteristic and a spoofed TLV type 0x07 field, aka the "Spoof and Management URL IP Redirect" attack.
