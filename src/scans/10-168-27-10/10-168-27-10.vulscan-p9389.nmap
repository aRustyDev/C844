Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in lemoon 2.0 and earlier allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified search parameters, possibly the q parameter.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue, saying "Sites are built on top of ASP.NET and you use lemoon core objects to easily manage and render content. The XSS vuln. you are referring to exists in one of our public sites built on lemoon i.e. a custom made site (as all sites are). The problem exists in a UserControl that handles form input and is in no way related to the lemoon core product."

| [CVE-2005-4346] Invalid SQL syntax error in blog.php in phpBB Blog 2.2.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain the full path of the application via an invalid permalink parameter to index.php, which produces an invalid SQL query that leaks the full pathname in a SQL syntax error message. NOTE: this was originally claimed to be SQL injection, but a cleansing step strips all non-digit characters and leaves an empty permalink argument, which leads to the syntax error.
| [CVE-2005-4326] The web interface for American Power Conversion (APC) PowerChute Network Shutdown performs all communication in cleartext (base64-encoded), which allows remote attackers to sniff authentication credentials.
| [CVE-2005-4324] Hitachi Groupmax Mail SMTP 06-50 through 06-52-/A and 07-00 through 07-20 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (service stop) via an e-mail message with an "invalid format."

NOTE: the normal operation of InfoPath appears to involve a local user without any privilege boundaries, so this might not be a vulnerability in InfoPath.  If no realistic scenarios exist for this problem in other products, then perhaps it should be excluded from CVE.

| [CVE-2005-4209] WorldClient webmail in Alt-N MDaemon 8.1.3 allows remote attackers to prevent arbitrary users from accessing their inboxes via script tags in the Subject header of an e-mail message, which prevents the user from being able to access the Inbox folder, possibly due to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
| [CVE-2005-4203] LogiSphere 0.9.9j does not restrict the number of messages that can be sent, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by sending a large number of messages via the msg command.  NOTE: due to lack of appropriate details by the original researcher, it is unclear whether this description accurately reflects the discloser's claim and is distinct from the XSS issue.
| [CVE-2005-4198] SQL injection vulnerability in index.php in Netref 3.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the cat parameter. NOTE: the provenance of this issue is unknown

| [CVE-2005-4148] Lyris ListManager 8.5, and possibly other versions before 8.8, includes sensitive information in the env hidden variable, which allows remote attackers to obtain information such as the installation path by requesting a non-existent page and reading the env variable from the resulting error message page.
| [CVE-2005-4134] Mozilla Firefox 1.5, Netscape 8.0.4 and 7.2, and K-Meleon before 0.9.12 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and delayed application startup) via a web site with a large title, which is recorded in history.dat but not processed efficiently during startup.  NOTE: despite initial reports, the Mozilla vendor does not believe that this issue can be used to trigger a crash or buffer overflow in Firefox.  Also, it has been independently reported that Netscape 8.1 does not have this issue.
